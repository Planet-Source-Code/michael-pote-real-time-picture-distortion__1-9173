Yawn I hear you say, Not another Flag waver that distorts a picture in a sine wave pattern....

But wait! How would you like code that does that, which is Fast (under 1 Millisecond!!!), Small (7 Lines!!!) and robust (loads of options), Well you've come to the right place come and check it out. I'm sure you'll be impressed.

P.S. Don't forget to vote :)
